Here is the Addon's Link -> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9gag-media-download-helper

**Instruction on how to use:**

- To get the most out of this add-on, open a post/gag in a separate tab then download the image/video by pressing right click on the image/video and selecting the "Download 9gag" option.
- A download pop up should open prompting you to select the location.
  The file name will be identical to the title of the post.
- Both images and videos can be downloaded from from main page as well.  But the title as file of the videos will work only when the video/gif is opened in a separate tab.
